## Using

This package implements the following commands:

### wp scaffold package

Generate the files needed for a basic WP-CLI command.

~~~
wp scaffold package <name> [--description=<description>] [--homepage=<homepage>] [--dir=<dir>] [--license=<license>] [--require_wp_cli=<version>] [--skip-tests] [--skip-readme] [--skip-github] [--skip-install] [--force]
~~~

Default behavior is to create the following files:
- command.php
- composer.json (with package name, description, and license)
- .gitignore, .editorconfig, and .distignore
- README.md (via wp scaffold package-readme)
- Test harness (via wp scaffold package-tests)

Unless specified with `--dir=<dir>`, the command package is placed in the
WP-CLI `packages/local/` directory.

**OPTIONS**

	<name>
		Name for the new package. Expects <author>/<package> (e.g. 'wp-cli/scaffold-package').

	[--description=<description>]
		Human-readable description for the package.

	[--homepage=<homepage>]
		Homepage for the package. Defaults to 'https://github.com/<name>'

	[--dir=<dir>]
		Specify a destination directory for the command. Defaults to WP-CLI's `packages/local/` directory.

	[--license=<license>]
		License for the package.
		---
		default: MIT
		---

	[--require_wp_cli=<version>]
		Required WP-CLI version for the package.
		---
		default: ^1.1.0
		---

	[--skip-tests]
		Don't generate files for integration testing.

	[--skip-readme]
		Don't generate a README.md for the package.

	[--skip-github]
		Don't generate GitHub issue and pull request templates.

	[--skip-install]
		Don't install the package after scaffolding.

	[--force]
		Overwrite files that already exist.



### wp scaffold package-tests

Generate files for writing Behat tests for your command.

~~~
wp scaffold package-tests <dir> [--ci=<provider>] [--force]
~~~

WP-CLI makes use of a Behat-based testing framework, which you should use
too. This command generates all of the files you need. Functional tests
are an integral ingredient of high-quality, maintainable commands.
Behat is a great choice as a testing framework because:

* It’s easy to write new tests, which means they’ll actually get written.
* The tests interface with your command in the same manner as your users
interface with your command, and they describe how the command is
expected to work in human-readable terms.

Behat tests live in the `features/` directory of your project. When you
use this command, it will generate a default test that looks like this:

```
Feature: Test that WP-CLI loads.

  Scenario: WP-CLI loads for your tests
    Given a WP install

    When I run `wp eval 'echo "Hello world.";'`
    Then STDOUT should contain:
      """
      Hello world.
      """
```

Functional tests typically follow this pattern:

* **Given** some background,
* **When** a user performs a specific action,
* **Then** the end result should be X (and Y and Z).

View all defined Behat steps available for use with `behat -dl`:

```
Given /^an empty directory$/
Given /^an empty cache/
Given /^an? ([^\s]+) file:$/
Given /^"([^"]+)" replaced with "([^"]+)" in the ([^\s]+) file$/
```

The files generated by this command include:

* `.travis.yml` is the configuration file for Travis CI.
* `bin/install-package-tests.sh` will configure your environment to run
the tests.
* `bin/test.sh` is a test runner that respects contextual Behat tags.
* `features/load-wp-cli.feature` is a basic test to confirm WP-CLI can
load.
* `features/bootstrap`, `features/steps`, `features/extra` are Behat
configuration files.

After running `bin/install-package-tests.sh`, you can run the tests with
`./vendor/bin/behat`. If you find yourself using Behat on a number of
projects and don't want to install a copy with each one, you can
`composer global require behat/behat` to install Behat globally on your
machine. Make sure `~/.composer/vendor/bin` has also been added to your
`$PATH`. Once you've done so, you can run the tests for a project by
calling `behat`.

**ENVIRONMENT**

The `features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php` file expects the
WP_CLI_BIN_DIR environment variable.

WP-CLI Behat framework uses Behat ~2.5, which is installed with Composer.

**OPTIONS**

	<dir>
		Directory path to an existing package to generate tests for.

	[--ci=<provider>]
		Create a configuration file for a specific CI provider.
		---
		default: travis
		options:
		  - travis
		  - circle
		---

	[--force]
		Overwrite files that already exist.

**EXAMPLE**

    wp scaffold package-tests /path/to/command/dir/



### wp scaffold package-readme

Generate a README.md for your command.

~~~
wp scaffold package-readme <dir> [--force]
~~~

Creates a README.md with Using, Installing, and Contributing instructions
based on the composer.json file for your WP-CLI package. Run this command
at the beginning of your project, and then every time your usage docs
change.

These command-specific docs are generated based composer.json -> 'extra'
-> 'commands'. For instance, this package's composer.json includes:

```
{
  "name": "wp-cli/scaffold-package-command",
   // [...]
   "extra": {
       "commands": [
           "scaffold package",
           "scaffold package-tests",
           "scaffold package-readme"
       ]
   }
}
```

You can also customize the rendering of README.md generally with
composer.json -> 'extra' -> 'readme'. For example, runcommand/hook's
composer.json includes:

```
{
    "extra": {
        "commands": [
            "hook"
        ],
        "readme": {
            "shields": [
                "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/runcommand/reset-password.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/runcommand/reset-password)"
            ],
            "sections": [
                "Using",
                "Installing",
                "Support"
            ],
            "support": {
                "body": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runcommand/runcommand-theme/master/bin/readme-partials/support-open-source.md"
            },
            "show_powered_by": false
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

* "shields" supports arbitrary images as shields to display.
* "sections" permits defining arbitrary sections (instead of default Using, Installing and Contributing).
* "support" -> "body" uses a remote Markdown file as the section contents. This can also be a local file path, or a string.
* "show_powered_by" shows or hides the Powered By mention at the end of the readme.

**OPTIONS**

	<dir>
		Directory path to an existing package to generate a readme for.

	[--force]
		Overwrite the readme if it already exists.



### wp scaffold package-github

Generate GitHub configuration files for your command.

~~~
wp scaffold package-github <dir> [--force]
~~~

Creates a variety of files to better manage your project on GitHub. These
files include:

* `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` - Text displayed when a user opens a new issue.
* `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` - Text displayed when a user submits a pull request.
* `.github/settings.yml` - Configuration file for the [Probot settings app](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/).

**OPTIONS**

	<dir>
		Directory path to an existing package to generate GitHub configuration for.

	[--force]
		Overwrite files that already exist.
